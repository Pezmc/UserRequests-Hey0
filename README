=Summary=
The objective of this plugin is to simplify the process of guest users without build permissions requesting build permissions and them being granted them by a mod. It means that the mod doesn't needed access to /modify or the database etc and makes it much easier to use.

=Features=
Database based player request logging
Email validation
Tells mods when user makes request
Checks every X seconds on a timer to see if there are any requests waiting & tells a mod if there are
Tells mods on login about waiting requests
List of requests
Get current request status

=Info=
The plugin uses a variety of commands to help with the task of giving new users (that you trust) build permissions. It does this by logging requests in a database with the users email (future features), and then mods are told that there are requests waiting, so they can go and check the person out and grant them permissions with one simple commands. It gets around the step of making people post on a forum, facebook page or similar and just makes it all easier!

If you have any advice, questions, improvements or ideas feel free to post them here. I hope you like the plugin!
