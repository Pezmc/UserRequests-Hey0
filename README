/**
 * Plugin for hey0 that allows users to request build access
 * this is logged in a db until they are accepted, the db
 * is used so you can use a cron job to check on unanswered requests
 * and send out annoying emails to mods
 * 
 * Simply use /request email@address.com and /ra username
 * 
 * See source or below for todo list
